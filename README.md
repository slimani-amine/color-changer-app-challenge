# Color Changer App Assessment

### Objective
Your task is to complete a simple app where clicking a button changes the background color of a box to a random color. 

### Instructions
1. Fork this repository.
2. Open the `script.js` file and complete the JavaScript code to:
   - Implement a `getRandomColor` function that generates a random hex color code.
   - Use this function to change the background color of the `#color-box` whenever the "Change Color" button is clicked.
3. Test your code to ensure it works as expected.
4. Feel free to improve the design using the provided `style.css` or add your own styles.
5. Submit the URL to your forked repository once you've completed the task.

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)
- Display the hex code of the randomly generated color somewhere on the page after changing the color.
