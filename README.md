# Color Changer App Assessment

### Objective
Your task is to create a simple app where clicking a button changes the background color of a box to a random color.

### Instructions
1. Fork this repository.
2. Open the `script.js` file and complete the following tasks:
   - Select the button and box elements using JavaScript.
   - Create a function that generates a random hex color code (e.g., `#3498db`).
   - Add an event listener to the button that calls the color-changing function when clicked.
3. Test your code to ensure it works as expected.
4. You can improve the design using the provided `style.css` or add your own styles.
5. Submit the URL to your forked repository once you've completed the task.

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)
- Display the hex code of the randomly generated color somewhere on the page after changing the color.
